# SpellHex Syllables
A compact application designed to breaking down English words into their vowel sounds and syllable count, aiding in spelling.

This application is currently in Beta, as its dictionary contains a limited number of words.

However, the application provides an option to search an online dictionary and retrieve word meanings.
